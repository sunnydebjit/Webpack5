# Webpack 5 Renovated

### Author: Debjit M.

It is quite often cumbersome for people joining new into web development get into a tutorial hell while learning a new concept. One of them is **_Webpack_**. Most beginners ignore it due to the intimidating configuration it requires to run properly. There are tutorials which use VsCode Plugins such as live-server and I have been one of them who never touched a Module Bundler and rather chose the easier Option.

Investing your time in learning it will make you a more confident developer, but for people who wish to get their hands dirty, I have setup this repo for you to download and play with it while you follow the Youtube Tutorials.

I have chosen the best and up to date configuration which you need in **_2022_** to work on core fundementals of **HTML, CSS, JS** with a dedicated dev server built in and Babel Transpiling so that your code is supported on older browsers as well.

> I request you to play with the code while you learn webpack or use it as your baseplate for development.

Included npm packages -

1. **Webpack**- _webpack, webpack-cli, webpack-dev-server, webpack-bundle-analyzer_
2. **Babel** - _@babel/core, @babel/preset-env, babel-loader_
3. **Styles** - _sass, sass-loader, css-loader, style-loader_
4. **Images/Resource** - *Asset/Resource Loader, *html-webpack-plugin\*

After cloning this repo make you install the packages with `npm install` on your bash|powershell terminal.

> Use these **_quick commands_** for your _build/dev_ work-
> To fine tune check the `webpack.config.js` , `package.json`

1. To start a **development server** with live/hot reloading run `npm run start`
2. To build your code for **production** run `npm run build`
3. To **visualize** _bundle size_ run `npm run stats`

I will keep this `Readme` updated in case some dependency has a change, overtime this would be polished, apologies in advance for any errors.
